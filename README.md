# Bottleneck

This mod adds some information to the stats panel to help find production bottlenecks. It will show the top 5 (configurable) planets an item is made on
and also try to assess what your assemblers are stuck on (needing items, no power, stacking). It also adds some filter buttons for limiting the items shown to 
only the precursor (or dependent) items to narrow down the search for bottlenecks

## Config

* ProductionPlanetCount allows showing more "Produced on" planets in tooltip (max 15)

## Notes
This mod was originally planned as an enhancement to the BetterStats (by brokenmass) mod which is why it borrows code from and depends on it. The plan is to remove that requirement at some point in the future.

## Installation

For now installation is only supported through a mod manager
