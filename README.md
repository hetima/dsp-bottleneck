# Bottleneck

This mod adds some information to the stats panel to help find production bottlenecks. It will show the top 5 planets an item is made on
and also try to assess what your assemblers are stuck on (needing items, no power, stacking). It also adds some filter buttons to make it quicker to see
the production rates of the precursor items of a given item.

This first version is mostly a rough draft. Originally it was submitted as a PR for BetterStats (which it depends on).
